# Base ESP32 Project (under development)

Based on my captive portal example but with RTOS, LittleFS and a basic webserver with chart.js

When you connect to the wifi "captive" password "12345678" it should take you straight to <http://4.3.2.1/> and display some simple text.

## Quickstart with ESP Home Flasher tool on Windows, MacOS and Linux

This is a simple GUI-based tool that can be downloaded from here: <https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases/>

If running Windows, you will most likely need a driver from here: <https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/ch340_driver.html> before your computer will show the COM port in ESPhome Flasher.
